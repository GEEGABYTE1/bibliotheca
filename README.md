# Bibliotheca 

Your online Bookmark Manager. Bibliotheca is an online web-app that allows you to keep your online bookmarks organized and not crammed below the search bar.

# User Notes
 Upon creating your account, there is an email verification that must be accepted that will be sent to the user's email that was used to create the account.

 Currently, in *version 1.0*, it is required that to view dashboard updates, the user must reload and sign in once again. It should be noted that this porblem is being worked on, and will be fixed in the next few updates.

# Next Planned Updates

Found below is a list of a few planned updates:
 - Reducing the amount of times the user has to reload and sign in to the platform to view dashboard updates.
 - Filtering Alerts to be more readable.
 - Adding Functionality to Unorganized Links where a user can add an unorganized link to a folder.
